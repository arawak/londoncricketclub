<p>The format is 16 overs per side. Play starts at 6pm, ends at 8:30pm. Teams are expected to maintain an over rate of no more than 4.5 minutes per over. No more than five minutes are allowed between innings. There is no drinks break.</p>
<p>Used white balls in good condition will be used. Winner of the toss may choose their ball.</p>
<p>Any ball not found within 2 minutes is declared lost.</p>
<p>Minimum 6 per side, maximum 8 per side. There will always be 8 fielders, with the batting side providing spare fielders as needed.</p>
<p>If one side is short, the other team will provide a batsman if needed, to bat last.</p>
<p>Teams will be divided between Earlybirds (come before 5:30 to set the ground up) and Latecomers (responsible for closing ground down).</p>
<p>The total overs per side shall be reduced by one over for every 8 mins that the start of the game is delayed. If the game has not started by 6:30pm it will be cancelled.</p>
<p>If not completed by 7:20pm, the first innings shall be declared closed at that time, and the second innings reduced to the same number of overs.</p>
<p>In general the MCC Laws of cricket shall be used except:</p>
<ul>
<li>any ball that passes the batsman on the leg side shall be called wide</li>
<li>any ball that passes outside the batsman's reach on the off side shall be called wide</li>
<li>no bowler shall bowl more than 4 overs</li>
<li>any short pitched ball (i.e. above the batsman's shoulders) will be called a no ball</li>
<li>any batsman retiring for any reason may resume his innings at the fall of a wicket</li>
</ul>
<p>and to be clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are no wide lines, and wides should be consistent with what a batsman cannot reach</li>
<li>there are no free hits off a no ball</li>
<li>no fielding limitations except as per Laws of Cricket</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>L.C.C. members get first priority, but non-members may play for $5 per game.</p>
<p>The emphasis in this format is having fun. If you're getting upset, you're doing it wrong.</p>
<p>Do your best when you are umpiring -- bad umpiring calls should be accepted and ridiculed after the match over a cold beverage.</p>
<p>Time is of the essence, so players need to turn up on time and keep things moving along.</p>
<p>L.C.C. practice kit shall be used, not the L.C.C. game kit.</p>

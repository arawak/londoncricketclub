Q: What am I signing up for?

A: Everyone pays the base membership fee, which gives the right to vote, hold office, and attend practices. Additionally, if any friendly or club matches are scheduled, all members may play these.

To play the league matches, members must join either the HDCL team, or the UFCL team. A league fee is charged for this, which is different for each league. Members will play on one team or the other, not both. Normally there is one game per weekend for each team.

The HDCL is the strictly competitive team, and members who wish to play on this team must try out. Anyone wishing to play on this team must commit to a minimum of 10 matches per season. This team will be selected at the beginning of May based on previous years' performances and indoor net sessions.

The UFCL team plays in a friendly league, and all members may join this team. There is no minimum commitment required, but the league fee is the same for all.

-----------------------------------------------------
Q: How do I sign up for indoor practices?

A: Contact Puneet at puneet_kushwaha@yahoo.com or 226-268-3806. The cost is $10 per session and equipment will be provided. These are generally run weekly.

-----------------------------------------------------
Q: Do I need my own equipment?

A: We do recommend getting your own if you are playing regularly, but the club has equipment for use by members.

-----------------------------------------------------
Q: I have never played cricket before, can I still join?

A: Certainly. We have had several new cricketers join over the years.

-----------------------------------------------------
Q: What format of cricket do we play?

A: Limited overs, either 40, 30, or 20 overs, depending on the league/competition.

-----------------------------------------------------
Q: What do I wear to the games?

A: All members are issued a coloured uniform before the start of the season. This is required for league games because they are played with a white ball. Club matches and friendlies are usually played with a red ball, in which case we wear cricket whites.

-----------------------------------------------------
Q: Where can I buy equipment?

A: In general, you will need to go to the Toronto area to find a cricket equipment store. Often we will make a group order from one of these stores in the spring at a slightly discounted rate.

Another option is to buy online from Walmart or Amazon:

Lastly, you can post a question to the mailing list asking if anyone is selling used equipment.
